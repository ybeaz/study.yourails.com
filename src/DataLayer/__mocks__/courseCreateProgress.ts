    "a war occurs when people can't agree and no one we certainly can't agree on the facts of the matter at hand with regard to the conflict in Israel my sense is most fundamentally that it's been hyper convenient for the radical islamists especially those in Iran to have Hamas and the Palestinians suffer greatly and continually so that they can be a constant go in the sight of Israel and the US and so we've stepped right into that as well um what's the solution well you know I'd be a fool to offer one wouldn't I because there's been a plethora of solutions offered with regards to Israel and the Palestinians over the last six decades and very little progress has been made on that front and I think the reason for that is that there are incredibly entrenched interests in whose interest it is to prolong and make as as bloody as possible this conflict and so there's no hope for peace under those circumstances and for the Islamic fundamentalists so-called Islamic fundamentalists who are fostering the conflict what a few hundred thousand or million Palestinian lives you know doesn't hurt them if all those innocent people die so that's a dreadful situation um if I was in Israel's shoes I suppose I would likely do much the same as they are doing with one possible Koda which is that as Israel becomes more successful on the military front which is highly likely the swing in popular opinion is likely to increasingly go against them because it's a lot easier to trumpet moral virtue by siding with the hypothetical victims than it is to celebrate the accomplishment of the conquerors and so I'm afraid that one likely outcome for Israel is that they win militarily but lose strategically however we'll see U one of the things I'm very happy about however and this is really a miracle and it's one that we should be very attentive to is that despite the rising temperature and costs of this conflict the Abraham Accords which established a certain degree of peace between Israel and a number of states who were previously in a state of enmity that Accord has held and that that's the best news on the geopolitical front that I can think of in the last 50 years you know there is some real possibility still that Israel and its neighbors could enter into a long-standing and productive peace and God we could all pray for that because that would be the best possible outcome for everyone involved I'm certain that Iran Iran does not believe that that pathway is in their interest and so they're going to do everything they can not only to Foster this war which is what they have been doing but also to fund and ferment all the protests that have been racking the Western World in support hypothetical support of Hamas let's end on a more positive note uh Jordan um I could talk to you all day in fact one day I want to do that it would be fascinating um you got L and I can't imagine anything being timed better than that especially in the aftermath of the absolute catastrophe that the presidents of upen MIT and Harvard have made of their uh Associated institutions yeah I mean we haven't touched on that but just quickly what what was your view of that it looked to me like finally the chickens came home to roost with the people that led those colleges who've been basically attacking Free Speech now for a number of years well I when I watched it I watched it in jaw dropped amazement I felt well what this is the testimony in DC of the three University presidents I thought two things I thought it's a complete bloody miracle that these people who've been clamoring for the Restriction of free speech on the basis of op and harm can't admit that c calls for the genocide of Jews no matter how arguably tangential don't violate these incredibly restrictive Free Speech codes which they themselves have been screeching about like mad harpies for decades so that was just a bloody Miracle of blind stupidity and it was a catastrophe as far as I was concerned that it characterized particularly MIT and Harvard because those were great places and then to Ally that with the implicit presumption as they did that it was self-evident that the moral stance that those same presidents took would be met with by the general public with nothing but open armed appreciation was also an indication of absolutely how absolutely demented and and self- deluding the universities have become and I say that apart from my financial interest in making Peterson acad work let's say and my moral interest as well I say that with no satisfaction whatsoever I worked at Harvard for six years and I loved it it was a great place and the halfwit Pharisees scribes and lawyers have you know wormed their way in with their idiot ideological moralizing and devastated those institutions you know and people like Bill Amman who sort of led the charge along with Christopher rufo with regard to Claudine gay the president of Harvard they've started to wake up to How Deep The Rot goes but you know they've just barely scraped the surface so many of our institutions of Higher Learning including those devoted to the hypothetically scientific Endeavor have become corrupted to the point where replacement is likely the only possible way forward you know like could Harvard find its way once again well maybe if you did what Elon Musk did when he took over Twitter and fired 95% of the administrators and a fair number of the faculty but who are you going to get to replace them and who's going to do that no parallel institutions are the name of the game now and you see that with the University of Austin you see it with Ralston College in Savannah and that's what we're going to try to do with Peterson Academy all the quality at 12th the price hopefully a limited amount of ideological moralizing we have great professors man we've got 30 professors who've already taped courses so I love the uh I love the ambition for this uh Jordan I've got to leave it there I don't want to but we've run out of time thank you so much for joining me a perfect way to start Piers Morgan uncensored for 2024 I wish you as I said a very happy New Year all the best with your your expanding
