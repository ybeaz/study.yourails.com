duck is one of the most daring
adventurers of all time

[Music]

this has got to be a fake and i bet
everything else is too
that's not true what about this picture
with chupacabra photoshop well this
treasure chest
probably bought it at an auction
this
ghost

gonna take to shuffle you off to the
afterlife
the head of scrooge mcduck

[Music]
yes
there's your head
i should have been more specific
[Music]

[Music]

we can explain we came down to your
secret museum to look for you because we
love you
secret museum this is the garage
the what do you mean garage no that's
ridiculous if this is a garage then how
do you explain all this amazing stuff
like the garden hose of destiny or
montezuma's stack of old magazines or oh
yeah no it's it's a garage
unbelievable i invite you into my home
you locked us in a room i gave you
marbles all we wanted was to hang out
with you well no you have and look at
the mess it's got me i guess family is
nothing but trouble right scrooge
everybody out but where are we
oh what are you gaping at the curse is
only activated if you ring the gong

sounds great not when you're duckberg's
single largest owner of gold
ah my money been

[Music]
where are you going

we're in cool
to be clear i'm gonna go catch the
dragon the hamburger was a metaphor from
before yeah yeah no we we get it we get
it but how are we gonna get up there
i'm a pilot

it'll take more than some fancy flying
to shake old scrooge cash cannibal

he'll take more than a bruised spine to
circle scrooge a bad
dragon dog

take
that

i thought i told you to go here no time
we gotta work fast webby how do we stop
it it's mystical so we need a mystical
device like an oblivion mirror or a
medusa gauntlet or like this

adventure of all know the ground

wrecked my home and my money bin
unleashed several ancient evils and
almost got me killed twice four times if
you count each monster as an individual
time
[Music]
[Laughter]
that was incredible when you pulled me
into the airplane and said no time oh
and who would have thought of a medusa
gauntlet brilliant oh and then you swung
me out and pulled up just in time and
you kids are nothing but trouble

worried sick call your grandma this
instant and tell her that you are
spending the night at a friend's house
okay
lying it's the responsible thing to do
[Music]
launchpad have you ever piloted a sub
before i sunk a helicopter in a wave
pool once same thing i have done more
with less no matter i'm back uncharted
territory bold new discoveries
bingo
i love road trips i've got snacks a
playlist of traditional sea shanties
matching family road trip shirts yeah
i appreciate the enthusiasm but there's
no time uh but according to the travel
itinerary
adventure isn't about planning it's
about doing so
what can i be in charge of the bus arms
sonic cannons no hyperdense zero point
energy missiles appears the scaly height
of a kraken none of those things are
real things this is your first
expedition so just stand back and watch
an old pro from a safe distance
so what is this submarine equipped with
seat belts
good one
classic scrooge dewey banter the
seasoned but tired explorer passing the
torch to his cocky young successor i'm
pretty sure he doesn't actually know our
names i'm sorry what i think he called
me herbert once don't be ridiculous hey
scrooge when are we gonna set sail
scrooge in a moment sunny gem
i will cram it down your throat guys
lighten up we're on a deep-sea
expedition with scrooge mcduck

mr mcquack charter course
next stop
the lost city of atlantis
in about 16 hours
shantae time
to see the ocean
[Music]
[Applause]
driving piloting driving right

hey scrooge first mate dewey here your
map scout is going the long way i could
probably find a shortcut if you just let
me glad the shortest distance between
two points isn't always a straight line
okay but yes it is so if you just go

driving
[Music]
hmm
shortcut achieved he'll thank me later

you kids with the death of me
do we do we will be the death of you
can we make a pit stop
i've used the bathroom but it's um
occupied for the love it's the middle of
the ocean there are no pit stops how
about that conspicuously unmarked
tankers

[Music]

so tell
i was raised by warrior monks who spoke
only the language of the blade

we've got intruders
scruggs what is he doing here strange
weather patterns in a mysterious
location near treasure
i knew he could resist heck triangulate
their subscores we'll tell scrooge and
steal the jewel out from under him

oh better idea knobbed the jewel and
killed them all somebody's angling for
employee of the month

[Music]
the drake barrier reef
powerful currents combined with rocky
terrain make it nearly impossible to
navigate but on that rare occasion when
snow falls above the reef the currents
cool allowing safe passage to
[Music]
are we there yet
right side or the left side just let me
there that thing is we found it
[Music]

yes good atlantis
ah
thanks for spoiling the moment
the whole place is upside down huh well
that's a new one

[Music]

wow
[Music]

just call your grandma already it's no
big deal
remember you're at a friend's house okay
you got this
hi granny i'm spending the night at a
friend's house so nothing is wrong oh
you don't got this aha
well according to these markings the
atlanteans were so eager to build an
epic city of wonders and death traps
they didn't stop to figure out a proper
support structure and the whole thing
fell into the sea
you kids best stay by the sub while i
scout ahead dewey ran in as soon as you
said death traps come on scrooge we got
this boy
what
say typing

you made me miss

me
brilliant i want screw to leave when i
shove the jewel of atlantis in his smug
face he thinks he's sewerage and so
scottish well i'm wearing a kilt mcduck
i killed

ah
lad
i thought the traps would get you for
sure
stupid upside down temple nothing cool
about walking under buzz saws from now
on don't touch
anything

[Music]

maybe atlantis was an ambitious first
outing
hi again granny still at a friend's
house
uh her name sub
ina
a totally real name for a definitely
real person
uh good try yeah
launch pad are you okay
ah little snake venom

hi nice to meet you i'm everybody's
friend
i've got to go to the bathroom
i'll be right back

suspension bridge chasm glowing blue
mystical lasers classic

even a basic death trap still has the
word death in the title

oh no
we'll find another route it's not safe
for amateur adventurers
that sounds like a challenge i have to
stress that is not a challenge is
exactly what you say to dissuade the
weak of heart from accepting the
challenge well challenge exactly there's
no challenge
[Music]

and now you know
who nailed it

[Music]
sure if you want to do it the easy way
why wouldn't you want to do it the easy
way you've got to work smart a lot not
harder
lad i don't call you old man or scottie
mctop hat respect your elder when you
adventure with scrooge mcduck but i'm
not you want me to adventure behind
scrooge mcduck or wait by the sub i
might as well be back on the houseboat
because you have no idea what you're
doing so show me give me a chance
instead of lumping us all together in
the backseat while you drive i'm not
lumping you all together oh really which
triplet am i it's
bluey

fantastic you see what i'm talking about
you fought find another way around we
are going to
push onward apparently

why this is no bathroom this shortcut
leads right to the treasure chamber i
don't even know why i hired the rest of
you help him up

[Music]
maybe i could just hire some family then
they'd have to listen to me
[Music]
there she is
the jewel of atlantis
[Laughter]
who's that flint-heart gloam gold the
poor man's version of me
which to be fair still makes him
insanely rich
they've got uncle donald what

let go of my uncle
no
i wasn't prepared for that
[Music]
what are you doing here flinty what are
you doing there slugs
ah they're perfectly fine oh yeah
back safe in the room with the fire and
the snakes what ah scroogie i see you
know my newest employee
your new job is with my sworn enemy i
can't get drunk around los muertos no no
donald has been a model employee
and an excellent prisoner
yeah
well what
hiring my own nephew in order to use him
against me now that is good planning
[Music]
have fun being the second richest dog in
the world for the next five minutes

i'd like to point out that this trap was
not my fault
junior woodchuck rule 841
there's always another way around

oh no no no no look uncle hampus is here
and he only speaks swedish we don't want
to be rude so
goodbye
and you're done yeah you're never going
to be able to back up that lie that was
crazy

[Laughter]
[Music]
we gotta stop the water
[Music]

ah

stop scrooge was trying to keep me out
of trouble but i was so caught up in why
is there a lamp on the floor
atlantis is upside down that means that
lamp was supposed to be on the floor
surrounded by all this treasure not a
boy lot keep going but why would you
surround that thing with treasure unless
that's the real jewel of atlantis
that thing lit up when the trap was
sprung up my bottom dollar it's the
power source that runs the city uncle
donald you gotta let the room flood so i
can grab the jewel
i'm supposed to watch yeah
trust you
well yeah that's kind of all you can do
this is a surprisingly insightful death
trap
[Music]

[Music]

[Music]
hey

um
[Music]

times

[Music]
hey team
wanted to thank you for keeping
scrooge's keen busy while i escape with
a jewel and blow up atlantis with my
most hated rival inside but i thought
employees were greatest treasurer of all
stop your ridiculous treasure is the
greatest treasure of all that's why it's
called treasure gobled out
we have to go

mr duck
maybe i'm a ride with you
[Music]

that was some quick thinking you just
may be an adventurer yet dewey

ladies and gentlemen of the press it is
with great pride that i flint her
glomgold present

an efficient clean source of energy that
could power duckberg for 50 years
courtesy of your friends at mcduck water
and electric oh mr mcduck how do you
respond to claims by other scottish
billionaires that they have the real
jewel that bubble
it's nice but it's obviously super
cursed no it's not

[Music]
how long
the whole time granny i can explain
dear you are safer in a sunken city with
scrooge mcduck than you are locked in a
vault in fort knox
no more lies
and you can go with him wherever you
like
no donald dude
i am not i'm a little over protector

oh
i may have left the engine running in
the houseboat

in the mansion
