duck is one of the most daring
adventurers of all time

[Music]

this has got to be a fake and i bet
everything else is too
that's not true what about this picture
with chupacabra photoshop well this
treasure chest
probably bought it at an auction
this
ghost

gonna take to shuffle you off to the
afterlife
the head of scrooge mcduck

[Music]
yes
there's your head
i should have been more specific
[Music]

[Music]

we can explain we came down to your
secret museum to look for you because we
love you
secret museum this is the garage
the what do you mean garage no that's
ridiculous if this is a garage then how
do you explain all this amazing stuff
like the garden hose of destiny or
montezuma's stack of old magazines or oh
yeah no it's it's a garage
unbelievable i invite you into my home
you locked us in a room i gave you
marbles all we wanted was to hang out
with you well no you have and look at
the mess it's got me i guess family is
nothing but trouble right scrooge
everybody out but where are we
oh what are you gaping at the curse is
only activated if you ring the gong

sounds great not when you're duckberg's
single largest owner of gold
ah my money been

[Music]
where are you going

we're in cool
to be clear i'm gonna go catch the
dragon the hamburger was a metaphor from
before yeah yeah no we we get it we get
it but how are we gonna get up there
i'm a pilot

it'll take more than some fancy flying
to shake old scrooge cash cannibal

he'll take more than a bruised spine to
circle scrooge a bad
dragon dog

take
that

i thought i told you to go here no time
we gotta work fast webby how do we stop
it it's mystical so we need a mystical
device like an oblivion mirror or a
medusa gauntlet or like this

adventure of all know the ground

wrecked my home and my money bin
unleashed several ancient evils and
almost got me killed twice four times if
you count each monster as an individual
time
[Music]
[Laughter]
that was incredible when you pulled me
into the airplane and said no time oh
and who would have thought of a medusa
gauntlet brilliant oh and then you swung
me out and pulled up just in time and
you kids are nothing but trouble

worried sick call your grandma this
instant and tell her that you are
spending the night at a friend's house
okay
lying it's the responsible thing to do
[Music]
launchpad have you ever piloted a sub
before i sunk a helicopter in a wave
pool once same thing i have done more
with less no matter i'm back uncharted
territory bold new discoveries
bingo
i love road trips i've got snacks a
playlist of traditional sea shanties
matching family road trip shirts yeah
i appreciate the enthusiasm but there's
no time uh but according to the travel
itinerary
adventure isn't about planning it's
about doing so
what can i be in charge of the bus arms
sonic cannons no hyperdense zero point
energy missiles appears the scaly height
of a kraken none of those things are
real things this is your first
expedition so just stand back and watch
an old pro from a safe distance
so what is this submarine equipped with
seat belts
good one
classic scrooge dewey banter the
seasoned but tired explorer passing the
torch to his cocky young successor i'm
pretty sure he doesn't actually know our
names i'm sorry what i think he called
me herbert once don't be ridiculous hey
scrooge when are we gonna set sail
scrooge in a moment sunny gem
i will cram it down your throat guys
lighten up we're on a deep-sea
expedition with scrooge mcduck

mr mcquack charter course
next stop
the lost city of atlantis
in about 16 hours
shantae time
to see the ocean
[Music]
[Applause]
driving piloting driving right

hey scrooge first mate dewey here your
map scout is going the long way i could
probably find a shortcut if you just let
me glad the shortest distance between
two points isn't always a straight line
okay but yes it is so if you just go

driving
[Music]
hmm
shortcut achieved he'll thank me later

you kids with the death of me
do we do we will be the death of you
can we make a pit stop
i've used the bathroom but it's um
occupied for the love it's the middle of
the ocean there are no pit stops how
about that conspicuously unmarked
tankers

[Music]

so tell
i was raised by warrior monks who spoke
only the language of the blade

we've got intruders
scruggs what is he doing here strange
weather patterns in a mysterious
location near treasure
i knew he could resist heck triangulate
their subscores we'll tell scrooge and
steal the jewel out from under him

oh better idea knobbed the jewel and
killed them all somebody's angling for
employee of the month

[Music]
the drake barrier reef
powerful currents combined with rocky
terrain make it nearly impossible to
navigate but on that rare occasion when
snow falls above the reef the currents
cool allowing safe passage to
[Music]
are we there yet
right side or the left side just let me
there that thing is we found it
[Music]

yes good atlantis
ah
thanks for spoiling the moment
the whole place is upside down huh well
that's a new one

[Music]

wow
[Music]

just call your grandma already it's no
big deal
remember you're at a friend's house okay
you got this
hi granny i'm spending the night at a
friend's house so nothing is wrong oh
you don't got this aha
well according to these markings the
atlanteans were so eager to build an
epic city of wonders and death traps
they didn't stop to figure out a proper
support structure and the whole thing
fell into the sea
you kids best stay by the sub while i
scout ahead dewey ran in as soon as you
said death traps come on scrooge we got
this boy
what
say typing

you made me miss

me
brilliant i want screw to leave when i
shove the jewel of atlantis in his smug
face he thinks he's sewerage and so
scottish well i'm wearing a kilt mcduck
i killed

ah
lad
i thought the traps would get you for
sure
stupid upside down temple nothing cool
about walking under buzz saws from now
on don't touch
anything

[Music]

maybe atlantis was an ambitious first
outing
hi again granny still at a friend's
house
uh her name sub
ina
a totally real name for a definitely
real person
uh good try yeah
launch pad are you okay
ah little snake venom

hi nice to meet you i'm everybody's
friend
i've got to go to the bathroom
i'll be right back

suspension bridge chasm glowing blue
mystical lasers classic

even a basic death trap still has the
word death in the title

oh no
we'll find another route it's not safe
for amateur adventurers
that sounds like a challenge i have to
stress that is not a challenge is
exactly what you say to dissuade the
weak of heart from accepting the
challenge well challenge exactly there's
no challenge
[Music]

and now you know
who nailed it

[Music]
sure if you want to do it the easy way
why wouldn't you want to do it the easy
way you've got to work smart a lot not
harder
lad i don't call you old man or scottie
mctop hat respect your elder when you
adventure with scrooge mcduck but i'm
not you want me to adventure behind
scrooge mcduck or wait by the sub i
might as well be back on the houseboat
because you have no idea what you're
doing so show me give me a chance
instead of lumping us all together in
the backseat while you drive i'm not
lumping you all together oh really which
triplet am i it's
bluey

fantastic you see what i'm talking about
you fought find another way around we
are going to
push onward apparently

why this is no bathroom this shortcut
leads right to the treasure chamber i
don't even know why i hired the rest of
you help him up

[Music]
maybe i could just hire some family then
they'd have to listen to me
[Music]
there she is
the jewel of atlantis
[Laughter]
who's that flint-heart gloam gold the
poor man's version of me
which to be fair still makes him
insanely rich
they've got uncle donald what

let go of my uncle
no
i wasn't prepared for that
[Music]
what are you doing here flinty what are
you doing there slugs
ah they're perfectly fine oh yeah
back safe in the room with the fire and
the snakes what ah scroogie i see you
know my newest employee
your new job is with my sworn enemy i
can't get drunk around los muertos no no
donald has been a model employee
and an excellent prisoner
yeah
well what
hiring my own nephew in order to use him
against me now that is good planning
[Music]
have fun being the second richest dog in
the world for the next five minutes

i'd like to point out that this trap was
not my fault
junior woodchuck rule 841
there's always another way around

oh no no no no look uncle hampus is here
and he only speaks swedish we don't want
to be rude so
goodbye
and you're done yeah you're never going
to be able to back up that lie that was
crazy

[Laughter]
[Music]
we gotta stop the water
[Music]

ah

stop scrooge was trying to keep me out
of trouble but i was so caught up in why
is there a lamp on the floor
atlantis is upside down that means that
lamp was supposed to be on the floor
surrounded by all this treasure not a
boy lot keep going but why would you
surround that thing with treasure unless
that's the real jewel of atlantis
that thing lit up when the trap was
sprung up my bottom dollar it's the
power source that runs the city uncle
donald you gotta let the room flood so i
can grab the jewel
i'm supposed to watch yeah
trust you
well yeah that's kind of all you can do
this is a surprisingly insightful death
trap
[Music]

[Music]

[Music]
hey

um
[Music]

times

[Music]
hey team
wanted to thank you for keeping
scrooge's keen busy while i escape with
a jewel and blow up atlantis with my
most hated rival inside but i thought
employees were greatest treasurer of all
stop your ridiculous treasure is the
greatest treasure of all that's why it's
called treasure gobled out
we have to go

mr duck
maybe i'm a ride with you
[Music]

that was some quick thinking you just
may be an adventurer yet dewey

ladies and gentlemen of the press it is
with great pride that i flint her
glomgold present

an efficient clean source of energy that
could power duckberg for 50 years
courtesy of your friends at mcduck water
and electric oh mr mcduck how do you
respond to claims by other scottish
billionaires that they have the real
jewel that bubble
it's nice but it's obviously super
cursed no it's not

[Music]
how long
the whole time granny i can explain
dear you are safer in a sunken city with
scrooge mcduck than you are locked in a
vault in fort knox
no more lies
and you can go with him wherever you
like
no donald dude
i am not i'm a little over protector

oh
i may have left the engine running in
the houseboat

in the mansion

export const text30 = `mayor Eric Adams is pushing back against Texas governor Greg Abbott's efforts sending tens of thousands of migrants to New York City Adams is putting in place new restrictions on the companies that operate the buses carrying Asylum Seekers and violations could mean charges interesting plan but will it work or is it too little too late six additional buses arrived at the Port Authority Bus Terminal overnight hours after mayor Adams issued a new executive order requiring 32-hour notice this s after 14 buses arrived from Texas in just one night so that we can be prepared so that when the migrants do arrive to New York City we can get them to where they need to get to safely fines and even criminal charges could be the consequences according to the city you allowed to drop off migrants in the city but you're going to do it at the location that we specify so we don't overtax our resources our [Music] Manpower here we are are at the Port Authority bus terminal in New York City where recently 14 buses arrived on a single day carrying Asylum Seekers from the US Southern border now each of these buses can seat between 50 and 60 people which means 14 of them can carry around 750 people who all arrived on the exact same day on top of that over 150,000 Asylum Seekers have already come through the city since this humanitarian Crisis began completely filling the city's Emergency Shelters and because of that New York City's mayor has decided to take drastic action to to limit the number of buses that can come to the city every single day mayor Eric Adams announcing an executive order first it will require that charter buses transporting migrants give New York City at least 32 hours advanced notice two it will require that these charter buses arrive only between 8:30 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. so now the way it works is buses from the southern border can only pull into this designated drop off spot during a 4-Hour window 5 days a week and bus companies who disobey this executive order in New York could face fines the buses could be impounded and people could potentially even be arrested and although this might limit the number of buses that come to the city every single day New York City is still the number one destination for folks seeking Asylum and that has to do with the city's unique right to shelter rules that guarantee temporary room and board to anyone who asks now bus companies faced with these restrictions in Chicago are just bringing their passengers to suburbs outside of the city and from the suburbs they can take a train or a ride shair to get into the city itself and while New York may only have this one particular bus terminal it's also got two airports and two train stations so there are other ways for people to get here using mass transit and this has the city's leaders very worried because if someone wants to come to New York City they still can and with the Asylum crisis estimated to cost the city $12 billion over the next 3 years it could mean that this executive order does little to impact New York City's overall predicament which is why the mayor recently told New Yorkers that the best way to solve this crisis is to take matters into their own hands [Music] [Music] so things are at a point now where the mayor is asking New Yorkers to ask the federal government for continued assistance with this crisis and this is because the city is completely out of resources which is forcing the city to make tough choices which could impact daily life for many of its residents specifically the city is now cutting funding for the fire department the police department schools and they're even going to fire the workers who take care of the city's Parks now many New Yorkers are completely upset with the idea of these Cuts but since the city is completely out of room and out of money there aren't a whole lot of good options left at this point the shelter at the Floyd Bennett Field which can house up to 2,000 migrants and was only opened about a month ago is already housing around 1400 people now this particular shelter made national news a month ago when the people who were brought there refused to to stay and that's because it's a former military Airfield outfitted with humanitarian style relief tents and apparently bathrooms are in a separate building from where the dormitories are on top of that the Airfield is prone to flooding which could make it dangerous as temperatures in New York continue to drop and for that reason the mayor is now calling on New Yorkers to ask their Federal elected officials for help but that's got many Americans scratching their heads because the reason the Asylum crisis has reached such proportions here in New York is because of New York's unique right to shelter rules for example the city has laws going back to the 80s that guarantee temporary shelter to anyone who asks for it these laws are unique to New York City and to many Americans including those running the federal government in Washington this situation could be one of New York City's own making which explains why even though the mayor's been to DC 10 times recently the federal government isn't completely sold yet on the idea of having the rest of the country support a city that they don't necessarily live in nor can vote in or have any effect on how the place is run as the city runs out of room to house migrants they've also been continuing their push with the the states to lift the right to shelter mandates which requires that the city provide shelter to anyone who needs it and this is why the rest of the country is somewhat reluctant to continue bailing out the city New York's right to shelter mandate goes back to the 1980s when the state supreme court ordered the city to provide shelter and to many Americans if this issue were really as big a deal as the mayor and other elected officials are making it out to be they would do something to amend the process for how the city handle situations like this and critics say that the city's present condition good or bad is the result of what New Yorkers vote for in fact many leaders in the city are in favor of maintaining right to shelter because it keeps families with nothing from having to live on the street but the problem is right to shelter is very expensive which is why the city has to make controversial cuts to education and police but the mayor says the city wouldn't have to make these Cuts if its wealthiest residents would just give it more money and some people think comments like this are the first step towards raising taxes because if Rich New Yorkers won't voluntarily turn over more of their money the city can come up with new taxes and fees to get more money that way and that might sound crazy until you consider just how deep the city's latest Cuts have had to go and how they could end up doing more harm than good it was a stark reminder that the budget cuts mayor Adams is ordered to help pay for the migrant crisis are very very very unpopular so none of the cuts that the M wants to make are popular at all especially those to police who are dealing with increased robberies and assaults to the fire department who recently rescued New Yorkers from a collapsing apartment building and very controversially cuts to New York City's under staff public schools which critics say will only hurt kids and the problem for New York City is that without funding from another source these cuts are going to have to happen and people are concerned the city could literally turn into a complete dump as the sanitation department stops emptying roadside trash bins like these right here which means even more trash than normal will start piling up along New York City's streets but the thing that's got a lot of New Yorkers upset is that the city claims it doesn't have the money therefore it has to make these Cuts but some people say that might not be true the city has actually owed $2.1 billion in uncollected fees and violations which if collected could be very helpful for funding things like schools and police and libraries and the fire department and the 1,400 parks department employees who are about to lose their jobs more than a thousand New Yorkers who help to keep our city parks clean are expected to lose their jobs this is one of many impacts of budget cuts announced last month so New York City's parks are world renowned we've got Bryant Park Central Park the Highline Park even Time Square qualifies as a park and although these parks are great now that might not be the case if these Cuts end up going through and 1,400 of the people that work at parks like this and take care of them end up losing their jobs on account of the city's Asylum crisis also Greenery and trees are such a rare commodity here in the city that a lot of people find find it unacceptable for all of this to go to waste because the city just stops taking care of it and on top of that the folks who empty these trash bins and keep these walkways clear are some of the city's neediest and they're the ones who are going to end up losing their jobs but budget cuts to New York City's and parks department could result in a filthy City and a loss of over 1,400 jobs including the agency's parks opportunity program so at issue here is the parks opportunity program which offers training to New Yorkers looking to build their skills and climb the city's economic ladders specifically the program employs New Yorkers at a rate of 1545 an hour to clean and maintain the parks for 40 hours a week too which means for many people this was a full-time source of employment and likely the only source of employment they could get because many of the people in this program don't have a high school diploma yet plus this program offers education that can help those get a high school equivalency degree and since studies show that not having a high school diploma can set people back for their entire lives this program was doing a lot of good for the people who needed it the most the program also offers other types of training for people who might want to be security guards or work in food preparation basically it's a program that was helping people get out of poverty while keeping the parks clean at the exact same time you're going to see more trash in Parks bathrooms if they are open at all are going to be places you're not going to want to be honestly that sounds terrible and these Cuts aren't going to improve anything for anybody in the city and critics of making cuts to this particular Parks program point out that $ 1545 an hour is $124 after 8 hours of work the city's shelter spend $400 a day taking care of people which is cheaper to pay people $124 a day to take care of the parks or to give them a place to live and no job for $400 a day it doesn't make any sense plus the people cleaning the parks are going to move on to better things after they get the training and just look at how much benefit this particular Park Bryant Park is for the city there's all these little shops and businesses it's a major tourist attraction and the apartments across the street from the park end up costing a whole lot more than they would if this park were a dump plus tourists who want to come to New York and maybe visit a park like this they spend $50 billion a year support 9% of the city's Workforce and add $6 billion a year to the city's piggy bank from taxes and we're going to jeopardize all of that because we don't want to pay people 15 bucks an hour that's not everybody agrees with that on top of that the city's parks department manages 14% of the land mass in New York City which used to get cleaned multiple times a week but now may only get cleaned one time a week but even though there isn't as much opposition to these particular Cuts as there are to others the city's education department is actually in court right now suing because the cuts to education might in fact be illegal so here we are at New York City's Flagship Public Library on 42nd Street which is no longer open on Sundays because of recent cuts and in addition to making cuts to the library the city is also making cuts to schools but teachers are fighting back the lawsuit alleges that Adams violated a state law which prevents the city from cutting education spending unless overall revenues decline so the city's teachers are in court right now suing because of the cuts which the city has to make because unfortunately there's no money left and the New York City public school system has one of the largest education budgets in the entire country the current school year is going to cost $ 37.5 billion but only 41% of that or around $15 billion to spent on actual classroom instruction which means there's likely to be some savings found in that other 59% of the budget that doesn't go towards teaching kids in classrooms according to court documents the city collected 8 billion more in Revenue last fiscal year than projected we have an historic reserves in the city of New York so the reason these Cuts might not actually be legal is because the city's tax revenue has actually gone up also these cuts are going to be pretty tough because if you look at this chart 41% of the city's money goes to non-negotiable mandated payments like employee benefits and pensions which could mean that the only areas that can be cut are those that affect kids directly directly school lunches classroom learning materials and the sad reality is that the school's massive budget probably can't be cut as much as anyone thinks which is why Emergency Services like the police and the fire department continue to experience Cuts even though their budgets are very small in comparison here we are at a police station and even though the police and the fire department and other Emergency Services have smaller budgets than the education department they're Contin to be cut and this past year the city spent $5.8 billion on police and only $2.7 billion on the fire department which is about what the city spends on the pensions for those in the education department and not only is the city cutting things like overtime pay and Staffing new local rules are complicating Matters by changing the way police do their jobs the other bill before city council is called how many stops it would require cops to record level one two and three stops sponsors of the bill say a cop would not have to record public interactions if say a tourist was to ask for directions so what's interesting about this bill is that although it may help spot unfair police practices it comes at a time when police are already stretched to the bare minimum and the law would require that police fill out reports every time they stop anyone in an official capacity now a tourist who needs directions in Time Square that's not a formal stop but if the police suspect you of doing something and they stop you they're then going to have to fill out one of these reports every minute and every second counts when you get to that job so we're going to have our officers sit there and do reports it makes no sense now proponents of this bill say that it's not all bad for the police because it could exonerate them when they're accused of unfair policing practices and if the police stop someone for something on the streets of New York the reasons for the Stop are going to be recorded which creates a paper trail of information concerning why the stop took place but extra work is going to take time and when there's an emergency situation the police don't have a whole lot of time something confusing about that last bill for a level one stop a person technically doesn't have to stay to give their information that cop will then have to use their perception to guess a person's race ethnicity and age so if officers have to guess a person's information critics say it might not end up being all that accurate or all that useful and although the idea is well intentioned is this the right time to try something out which takes the police time and gives them less opportunity to stop crime and because the city's managing a humanitarian crisis we're about to have the lowest level of police by 2025 because Police Graduation classes those are being canceled as well which means new officers aren't coming into the force and Veteran officers are retiring if current police retire and you aren't training new police when new police eventually do come in the veterans needed to Mentor them and help them rise through the ranks and make a career out of being a cop in New York won't be there and critics say policies like this could set the force back years which is why the mayor and city leaders want more help managing the humanitarian crisis that's taking place here right now but should they get it and do you think limiting the number of buses that come to New York is going to change how many people decide to come here and seek Asylum let me know thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video`
